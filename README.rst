CAN HDL Project
'''''''''''''''

This project contains VHDL source code to implement a CAN controller. I have been working on this project mainly for fun during the Riscure rhme3 hardware hacking challenge. 
The main goal was to have a flexible can controller that can be used for all sorts of fidling activities.

The biggest achievement so far is a can controller implemented in VHDL that can be used with tools like sclan, and canard.io.
